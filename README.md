Just a simple proof-of-concept sudoku solver.

To run:

```
git clone https://github.com/thebjorn/sudoku.git
cd sudoku/sudoku
python board.py
```

The steps the solver finds, and the resulting actions, are printed to the console.
When the solver finishes it displays a the grid and lets you navigate between the
steps.
